# Software IPv6 Router in Rust 
*University of Cambridge Part II (3rd Year) Dissertation*

The router itself is called Luyou, and the test framework Luxing, with a test client called Luxingke and test server called Luxingfu.

For more information please check out my dissertation in ./dissertation/

To run the router:
Build the router (under ./rust/router)
Run ./test.sh
This will run the test in ./python/test/test_playground.py

Please note that [Mininet]{http://mininet.org} must be installed for the test bench to run, but is not required by the router itself.

If you have any questions please email: ollie@ollie299792458.co.uk
